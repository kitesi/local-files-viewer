load as text file, other files?
or if file size is lower than amount load

ERRORS:
- action errors: show up in notification bar
    - goto() fails
    - change baseDirectory fails
- medium errors
    - can't handle mime type
    - filesize too big
    - in directory

caching?

need to handle collapseDirectory and all that
regardless file pallete should only show things in $files

initially load with 3 directorys deep

a. keep requesting in the background
    1. on baseDirectory just keep adding a level, completely set the $files again
    2. on indidvidual folders, doesn't completely set the $files, idk if preformance benefit
