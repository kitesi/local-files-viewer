## Future

- Look into optimizations of reading and showing content
- Handle large directories more gracefully. Originally the idea was to load x amount deep, then when the user
  requests load more, but with the file picker I switched it back to loading
  recursively as much as needed.
- Error handling
  - Remove the need for two states of errors.
  - You should be able to change the base directory on the error page.
- Error text is white on white background
- API is very loose and not consistent
